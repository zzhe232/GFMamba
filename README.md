# 🎭 GFMamba: Multimodal Sentiment Analysis with Mamba-based Fusion

A PyTorch-based implementation of **multimodal sentiment analysis**, using the **GFMamba** model that integrates **text**, **audio**, and **vision** features for tasks like CMU-MOSI and CMU-MOSEI.

---

## 🧠 Model Overview

**GFMamba** is a multimodal fusion model that leverages the Mamba architecture to integrate and learn from:

- `Text` (language content)
- `Audio` (voice tone & prosody)
- `Vision` (facial expressions & motion)

It performs **regression-based sentiment prediction**, aiming to predict a sentiment score per utterance or clip.
datasets use cmu-mosi, if you want to transfer other datasets, you can change the yaml and datasets floder
